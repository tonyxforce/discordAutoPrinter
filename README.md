Automatically slices and prints an stl file sent to the bot

Please, I implore you, never ever use this bot. It stands as one of the worst ideas I've ever had. The sheer disappointment I feel while writing this code is overwhelming and indescribable. Every line of code I write only adds to my frustration and regret. I had high hopes for this project, but the reality has fallen drastically short of my expectations. The bot fails to meet even the most basic standards, and I cannot in good conscience recommend its use to anyone. Trust me, you're better off without it.
